A set of python scripts for running WRF and associated
programmes, WPS, UPP, NCL etc.

Designed to be quickly hackable. Everyone needs 
a scripting framework for running WRF, but no 
once size fits all.

Everything is controlled by a configuration file
which mimicks the namelist.input format. This state
is held in a dictionary, which is the sole argument
to many python methods.

The outer-level loop is executed in run_forecast.py, 
while mostof the functions are contained in wrftools.py.
If you find it useful, please contribute, it could use some
tidying up.
