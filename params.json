Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator.

It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Written by \r\n@samwisehawkins ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
